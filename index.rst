MS: Unsupervised Identification of Functional Domains on Spatially Resolved Brain Cell Atlas
=============================================================================

Introduction
========

MS is designed for automatically tissue structure identifications on spatially resolved single cell data, for example, STARmap, MERFISH, slide-seq, etc.

MS support both multi-slice and single-slice analysis. MS's best advance is to analyze very large scale datasets. MS can finish the task within an hour to process an atlas-scale datasets containing 1 million cells.

MS can also support tissue visualizations by embedding the MS-representation into a color space.

MS support 3D datasets.
